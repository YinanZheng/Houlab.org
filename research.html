				<h1>Research Interest</h1>
				<p id = "pgrey">Dr. Hou’s Population Epigenetics Laboratory conducts molecular epidemiology studies to identify molecular biomarkers and mechanisms that can predict disease risk, progression, 
				and mortality in diverse populations. Our laboratory also tests whether these biomarkers can be used to assess the efficacy of interventions, thus providing providing potential 
				tools for disease prevention and treatment.</p>
				<br/><br/>
				<p id = "pgrey">The overarching research focus of Dr. Hou’s Population Epigenetics Laboratory is to understand the biological mechanisms and identify 
				biomarkers linking environmental and behavioral lifestyle factors with subclinical or clinical disease development, with the ultimate goal of developing effective strategies based on these 
				findings for early detection, prevention, clinical intervention, and treatment of human diseases. The environmental/lifestyle risk factors that we have studied include air pollution, pesticides, 
				being overweight or physically inactive, numerous micronutrient intakes, and prenatal exposures in utero. Our primary focus is cancer, but our research involves a variety of other chronic diseases 
				and adverse outcomes including cardiovascular and respiratory disease, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in adults and/or neonates/children.</p>
				<br/><br/>
				<p id = "pgrey">The integration of molecular epidemiology, bioinformatics, 
				and other advanced statistical techniques offers new insights into the role of environmental and lifestyle factors that affect genetic susceptibility to and risk of developing chronic diseases. 
				Recent technological advances provide an enormous amount of “omic” data, from whole-genome sequencing to extensive transcriptomic, methylomic, and metabolomic data. We have used these data in 
				conjunction with our expert team to investigate genetic factors (e.g., mutations/polymorphisms, telomere shortening, and mitochondrial DNA variations) and are currently focusing on epigenetic 
				factors (e.g., DNA methylation, histone modifications, and long non-coding RNA and microRNA profiles) which modify gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence. We have generated 
				and analyzed abundant genome-wide epigenetic profiling data for several large cohort studies including the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA), the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), 
				and the Normative Aging Study. Our current team includes PhD and Master’s students, postdoctoral fellows, international visiting scholars, and global health exchange students, each of whom brings unique 
				ideas and expertise. We are committed to training the next generation of scientists who are interested in the epigenetics of disease development and prevention.</p>
